# Solution for week 5 assignment

Homework was very similar to the code done in the classes. 
Had some problem because originally the files were .csv and in this edition are .csv.gz.
Has to unzip the files first (even though supposedly they are able to read both formats).

In this week's folder I also include the code I put in the notebook to solve the problems.

### Question 1

Just run the command

### Question 2

Just did the same code, had to change the schema slightly. 

### Question 3 

For this question, I had to go back and unzip the file. Then I just did an SQL query. 

### Question 4

Just did the SQL query.

### Question 5 

Just it what it is

### Question 6

Joined on the zones id (similar to classes) and did the SQL query.
